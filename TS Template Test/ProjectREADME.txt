Concepts covered:
-Typescript as a wrapper around JS. 
-Assigns types to JS to avoid problems that would not throw their own error
-Compiled to JS. Play ground on the TypeScript website
-How to compile TS in Visual Studio. As always using VS has a bit of a learning curve at first with new concepts so this took a sad amount of work.
-Assigning a type with ":"
-Custom types
-Type Alias
-Function Types
-Had to upgrade the TS install on Visual Studio to 2.0.3
-The never type
-adding tsconfig.json
-strictnullchecks
-Typescript compiler, compiles even with errors. tsconfig file lets you change that however
-TS has good documentation. Favorited it. 
-No unused paramaters
-Let and const
-Block scope
-Arrow functions
-Default paramters
-Rest and Spread
-Destructuring
-Namespaces and Modules
-Interfaces
-Decorators
-Installing 3rd party libraries like jquery
-"Definitly typed" for pre written type script repositories
-tsconfig.json compilation options (just check the official documentation)











Needs more research:
-The never type
-Using interfaces
